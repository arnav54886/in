        <p>MY INSIPIRATION TO MAKE THIS APP   
             one day i was watering my plants in my garden.Suddenly my cellphone rang.It was my friend. 
            He told me about the terrible accident that happened with him . 
            His grandparents were alone at home when fire spread at his home.
             Thankgod,that the firebrigade came to save early.still my friend's grandparents were severly injured.</p>
             <p>due to many old people found very difficult to use smart phones in daily life.I thought of making an emergency app.</p>
